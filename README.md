# Azure DevOps Automation Project

## Overview
This project automates the creation of Azure DevOps projects using Python. It leverages the Azure DevOps REST API to programmatically set up new projects, provision Azure infrastructure with Terraform, configure it using Ansible, and establish CI/CD pipelines with Azure Pipelines. The goal is to demonstrate a comprehensive DevOps pipeline implementation, showcasing cloud infrastructure, automation, and continuous deployment.

## Prerequisites
- Azure DevOps account
- Azure subscription
- Python 3.6 or later
- Terraform 0.12 or later
- Ansible 2.9 or later
