# Define variables specific to the apache-reverse-proxy role that may vary between different environments or deployments.

# backend_server_url: The URL of the backend server that the reverse proxy will forward requests to. 
# This is typically an internal service or a load balancer in front of multiple services.
# In a live environment, replace the placeholder with the actual URL of your backend service.
# Example:
# backend_server_url: "http://<actual_backend_service_url>/"

# apache_listen_port: The port on which Apache listens for incoming traffic. 
# While 80 is common for HTTP, you might use 443 for HTTPS in production environments with SSL/TLS configuration.
# Example for demonstration:
# apache_listen_port: 80

# Use these variables in your role's tasks where appropriate to configure Apache based on your specific requirements.
