# Azure DevOps Pipeline Demo

This simple Azure DevOps pipeline demonstrates basic YAML configuration for automated builds on the Ubuntu latest virtual machine, triggered by changes to the `master` branch.

## Configuration

- **VM Image**: Runs on `ubuntu-latest`.
- **Trigger**: Activates on updates to `master`.
- **Steps**:
  - **Echo Hello World**: A one-line script to print "Hello, world!".
  - **Multi-line Script**: Executes multiple echo commands for demonstration.

## Usage

Remember to adjust any specifics like the branch name (master might be main in some repositories) or add more detailed explanations as necessary for your project's context.
